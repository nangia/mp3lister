# mp3lister
A friend has a mp3 player where one can navigate through mp3 files by inputting the number
of mp3 file on a remote. Since there are a number of music files that he has, it is desirable
to have a printed copy of mp3 files along with what each file contains.

This python code walks through the mp3 files and then generates a .csv file for it. Open the .csv file, format it appropriately and print it.

Tested with python 2.7.10 and on Mac OS X 10.10.5 though it should work on other platforms too.
