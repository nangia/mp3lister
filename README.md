# mp3lister
A friend has a mp3 player where one can navigate through mp3 files either by inputting the number
of mp3 file on a remote or forward/reverse buttons. Since there are a large number of music files that he has, it is desirable
to have a printed copy of mp3 files indicating the number along with what each file contains.

This python code walks through the mp3 files and then generates a .csv file for it. Open the .csv file, format it appropriately and print it.


# Requirements

To run this you should have python 2.7.10. Have tested it on Mac OS X 10.10.5 though it should work on other platforms too.

Use the following command to install python dependencies.
